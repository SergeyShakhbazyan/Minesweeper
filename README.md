# Minesweeper

This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game using C++ and Qt.

## How to Play

- Click on a cell to reveal it.
- Right-click to place a flag on a suspected mine.
- The numbers on revealed cells indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
- Clear all non-mine cells to win the game!
